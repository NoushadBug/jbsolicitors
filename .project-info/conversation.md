jbsol (time-00:06:58): You can hear me? Yeah, so when you sent over the staff,
And you… did you test it out, and then it ended up working, was it?
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:07:11): Yes, it was working. I did some small testing in the website. Yeah, it was working.
jbsol (time-00:07:20): Yeah, and so, under which fields, I mean, like, what type of fields would it fill out?
all the fields that I gave you, right, in the…
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:07:30): Well, actually, I forgot, because I tested it, very long, earlier, so…
If you can give me the access again, like, maybe we can shortly see right now.
jbsol (time-00:07:45): Yeah, did you need access?
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:07:47): Yes. What I remember, yeah, most of them…
was, able to be automated. Like, we can control.
jbsol (time-00:07:57): Yeah, okay, cool. So, but did you need… did you need,
access to the sheet or the CRM.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:08:05): Both of them.
jbsol (time-00:08:08): Yeah, okay, well… There's a specific link, I wouldn't be able to find it.
Exactly.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:08:42): In our previous meeting, you shared the link, I guess. I lost it.
jbsol (time-00:08:49): Yeah, I just sent it in the, Zoom chat.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:08:52): Okay.
jbsol (time-00:08:53): And then that… I think you would have been set up with a password or something, I'm not sure.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:09:02): Okay, let me see…
Yeah.
I just logged in.
jbsol (time-00:09:11): Yeah, and then, the… .
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:09:17): Should I screen share something?
jbsol (time-00:09:19): Yeah, yeah, that'd be good, yeah. I shared the Google Sheet, it's just called Lead Generation December 2025.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:09:28): Okay.
Can you see my screen?
jbsol (time-00:09:37): No.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:09:48): How about now?
jbsol (time-00:09:50): Yeah, yeah, you can see it now.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:09:53): Okay.
What was the sheet name, again?
jbsol (time-00:09:57): lead generation December 2025.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:10:03): Okay.
This one.
jbsol (time-00:10:16): Yeah, that's the one.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:10:19): Okay.
So… So, first of all, we will need to go to…
jbsol (time-00:10:30): Inquiries.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:10:31): And queries, okay.
jbsol (time-00:10:33): And then key opportunities.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:10:38): Alright. Then enable the key opportunities, okay.
jbsol (time-00:10:42): Yep.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:10:47): Well… nothing is arriving.
jbsol (time-00:10:50): Oh, you gotta apply, apply search, apply search.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:10:55): What was that, sorry?
jbsol (time-00:10:57): Apply search, that, that button.
Apply search.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:11:02): It's next to…
jbsol (time-00:11:05): Yeah, let's okay.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:11:05): Okay.
jbsol (time-00:11:10): Turn off my key opportunities.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:11:13): Can't.
jbsol (time-00:11:15): Yeah.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:11:18): Okay.
jbsol (time-00:11:18): Yeah.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:11:19): And then we will need to go one by one, right?
jbsol (time-00:11:23): Yeah, I get… yeah, pretty much.
Oh, well, it has to be assigned to Audrey.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:11:30): No.
jbsol (time-00:11:31): How to do that?
Okay, so press on the three lines.
The three lines next to Apply Search.
The three, the green line, the green, no, the green lines.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:11:45): Yep.
jbsol (time-00:11:46): Assigned to, and then go to Audrey.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:11:52): This one.
jbsol (time-00:11:53): Yep.
And then apply such, yeah.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:11:57): Okay.
Gotcha.
And then click on these three dots, right?
jbsol (time-00:12:06): Yeah. Oh, well, no, you have to… well, if you're creating contact, then you have to press the plus.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:12:14): Okay.
We need to create contracts, right? Not, edit anything.
jbsol (time-00:12:20): Yeah, we have to create contacts here in key opportunities.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:12:25): Right.
Alright.
And then I will go to the sheet, and… Take the title, Okay.
So, pretty much, these are the… all things. Is there any, logic or conditions?
and it'.
jbsol (time-00:12:51): Yeah. Source, I mean, it should all be there, so Source would be… Ava?
other. So, so there's, like, that dropbox.
Yeah, like, other…
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:13:11): Okay.
jbsol (time-00:13:12): And then, area of law would be advice.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:13:19): advice. All kinds, these two will be the same. Yeah.
jbsol (time-00:13:23): Yeah, yeah, yeah, because, I mean, it's just, we have to do that as a, you know what I mean? Like, as a,
As a prerequisite. If you press organization, then we need… we also need the details of that, so organization, yeah.
We need that put in, and that, that depends on the field, yeah.
Organization, yeah. Yeah, and then,
it has to be, assigned to Audrey, and…
Assigned by Audrey. So if you go down…
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:13:56): So…
jbsol (time-00:13:58): Like this. Oh, yeah, yeah, so if you go back, yeah, if you go down… So, like, scrolling down.
It has to be assigned… assigned to Audrey.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:14:09): Or less, right?
jbsol (time-00:14:10): Yeah, always assigned to order, yeah.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:14:13): Okay.
And the follow-up and reminders?
With this?
jbsol (time-00:14:20): it can… I think it should automatically be the day of, like, as in the day that it was… it, like, entered, so that's fine.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:14:30): Understood.
Okay.
Okay, perfect. No proceeding?
jbsol (time-00:14:36): just leave that, it's for… It is… just leave that, yeah.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:14:41): Okay.
So, in short…
jbsol (time-00:14:45): watch it.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:14:47): So we need to enter the contract details, organization, key opportunity, and then the assignment only.
jbsol (time-00:14:57): Yep.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:14:58): We don't need to touch any of them, right?
jbsol (time-00:15:01): No, no, no, none of those, none of those.
So, if we, if you go up…
It's, yeah, so it's name, it's name, last name, email, email, mobile, And then…
that's pretty much it, because I don't think we're doing… we normally would do source notes or internal notes, but we don't… we're not doing that anymore.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:15:23): Okay, but, I think telephone is also a required field.
jbsol (time-00:15:28): Yeah. Yeah, so if you go back onto the sheet, is it different?
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:15:33): Oh, we got telephone.
jbsol (time-00:15:34): Yeah, yeah, so, yeah, okay, so, so, yeah, telephone as well. Telephone, mobile, source, but you don't need the source notes anymore. So, yeah, source notes we don't have to do.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:15:46): All those others.
jbsol (time-00:15:49): Yeah, yeah, source… source is always other, but source notes, we don't… we don't… we're not doing them anymore. We're not doing source notes anymore.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:15:57): So you're saying, we should…
jbsol (time-00:16:00): No, we're not, we're not, we're not doing any more, no, yeah.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:16:03): Okay, okay.
jbsol (time-00:16:04): Oh, actually, no, no, we are, we are, we are. Just… yeah, just, we're doing sales notes, yeah, never mind, sorry.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:16:09): Okay.
Okay, what else?
What is, okay, yeah, I got you.
jbsol (time-00:16:19): And then anything, yeah. That's it.
And that's it, yeah.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:16:25): Oh, what is the assigned by, where it is?
jbsol (time-00:16:28): Where, yeah, where, where your name is.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:16:32): So, I think it's coming automatically, whoever is logged in.
jbsol (time-00:16:35): That's coming automatically from whoever, yeah, is logged in. Look…
it doesn't matter too much, but, I mean, who would this… if the extension is running through Audrey.
then it would just be automatically Audrey, correct?
Yeah, so, yeah, okay, so then, yeah, it's fine, you could probably just leave that. It'll just automatically do it. But assign two always to Audrey.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:17:00): Okay, so, the automation we are thinking about, is it, always, be running thing, or, it is a one-time run solution?
jbsol (time-00:17:13): Oh, no, it'll… it'd kind of be, like…
always running, but it would be, like, we could do it, like, once a day or something, you know what I mean?
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:17:24): Understood. In that case, the automation, if you want to run this thing, you need to keep open your browser.
jbsol (time-00:17:34): Yeah, yeah, yeah, correct, yeah.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:17:35): your PC should not be, in sleep or, in turn of, you know.
jbsol (time-00:17:42): Yeah, yeah.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:17:43): should be quicker. And…
One other thing is, when I, write the script, I need to test these, entries. So, is it okay if I entry some of them?
jbsol (time-00:18:00): Yeah, yeah, for sure.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:18:01): From this account.
jbsol (time-00:18:03): Yeah, sure, yeah.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:18:05): Understood.
So that's it. After doing this, we need to click on save and close, right?
jbsol (time-00:18:14): Yep.
Yep.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:18:15): And then, click on, again, the…
The plus button, and then add…
jbsol (time-00:18:22): Yeah, yeah.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:18:23): The rest of them.
Understood.
jbsol (time-00:18:24): Yeah, that's correct, yeah.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:18:26): So how many, entries we need to insert, insert?
In a certain iteration.
jbsol (time-00:18:35): I mean, it doesn't… it depends. It depends on how many new entries we put in, but yeah.
It depends on how many entries we get into the Excel sheet, yeah.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:18:46): Do you have any idea, or estimation?
jbsol (time-00:18:50): We're trying to… maybe about 70 a day or something.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:18:53): 70 a day, yeah.
jbsol (time-00:18:56): Yeah, yeah.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:18:57): It'd be nice.
jbsol (time-00:18:57): About, about, about that, yeah.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:19:00): Understood.
Let's say 200.
jbsol (time-00:19:03): Yeah, yeah.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:19:06): Got you. Alright, perfect. I think we should, be able to do it.
Yep.
jbsol (time-00:19:16): Cool. And so, I guess for the order, do I… I mean, how do I place the order? Do I just, like, go on your…
No.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:19:25): Well, I'll need to send you a offer in the inbox, and you just need to accept that. After accepting, the timer gets started, and within that time frame, I need to deliver it to you.
After that, you can, confirm if everything is alright, and you can connect with me if needed, you know.
jbsol (time-00:19:48): Okay, well, but is the timer, as in, when… from the time that I start, you'll confer… you start the timer, if that's outside of my work hours?
Or will… can you stop the project to see if it needs any revision, and then I'll come back to it tomorrow?
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:20:06): Yeah, of course. You have a certain amount of time to review the project as well, so no worries.
jbsol (time-00:20:13): Oh, okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, cool. Yeah, okay.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:20:16): And also, I cannot complete within one day, so you can.
jbsol (time-00:20:19): Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, alright, it sounds good, Nishad, then, yeah, just send me that offer over, thanks for your help, bro.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:20:28): Of course, yeah.
You have already shared the, the sheet, right? With me?
jbsol (time-00:20:36): Yeah, yeah, that's the sheet, yeah, yeah.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:20:39): Understood.
Alright then, do you have any question to me, you know, something?
jbsol (time-00:20:46): Not really, I mean, just more,
How long do you reckon it'll take?
Because we've got a new guy in, so we kind of need this up and running kind of quick, but we don't want to cut corners, obviously.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:21:01): Okay, I think, within 2 or 3 days? Let's say 2 days.
jbsol (time-00:21:07): Yep.
Cool.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:21:08): Okay.
jbsol (time-00:21:10): Makes sense. Yeah, that's all from me. Thanks for your help. Yeah, send that offer over, and then, I'll confirm the order, and whatever, yeah.
Noushad Bhuiyan (time-00:21:18): Of course, yeah.
Okay, okay then, sending you the… in the, in the, chat.
Yeah.
jbsol (time-00:21:27): Have a chat.
