5:19 - jbsol
Yeah, did you need access?
5:22 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Yes. What I remember, most of them was able to be automated.
5:29 - jbsol
Like, we can control. Yeah, okay, cool. So did you need access to the sheet or the CRM?
5:40 - Noushad Bhuiyan

6:23 - jbsol
Yeah, just sent it in the Zoom chat.
6:27 - Noushad Bhuiyan

7:51 - jbsol
Yeah, that's the one.
7:53 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Okay. So... So... So first of all, we will need to go to inquiries, okay, and then key opportunities. All right, then enable the key opportunities, okay.
8:17 - jbsol
Yeah.
8:22 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Well, nothing is arriving.
8:25 - jbsol
Oh, you got to apply search, apply search.
8:30 - Noushad Bhuiyan
What was that, sorry?
8:32 - jbsol
Apply search, that button. Apply search.
8:37 - Noushad Bhuiyan
It's next to me.
8:39 - jbsol
sorry.
8:40 - Noushad Bhuiyan
that's okay.
8:45 - jbsol
I'll turn off my key opportunities.
8:48 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Okay.
8:50 - jbsol
Yeah. Okay.
8:54 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Yeah. And then we will need to go one by one, right?
8:58 - jbsol
Yeah, I get, yeah. Oh, well it has to be assigned to Audrey, so press on the three lines, next to apply search, the green lines, assign to, and then go to Audrey. This one? Yeah, and then apply search, yeah.
9:32 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Okay. Got you. And then click on these three dots, right?
9:42 - jbsol
Yeah, well, no, you have to, if you're creating contact then you have to press the plus.
9:50 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Okay. We need to create contacts, right?
9:54 - jbsol
Yeah, we have to create contacts. Yeah, we have to create contacts, yeah, key opportunities.
10:05 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Alright, and then I will go to the sheet and take the title. Okay, so pretty much these are the all things. Is there any logic or conditions?
10:26 - jbsol
Yeah, source, I mean it should all be there, so source would be other. A? Other, so there's like that dropbox. Yeah, like other. Okay. And then area of law would be advice.
10:55 - Noushad Bhuiyan
All time these two will be the same.
10:58 - jbsol
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because the. The. I mean, it's just, we have to do that as a, you know what I mean, like as a prerequisite. If you press organization, then we need, we also need the details of that, so organization, yeah, we need that put in, and that, no, that depends on the field, yeah, organization, yeah, yeah, and then it has to be assigned to Audrey, and assigned by Audrey, so if you go down. So, like this, yeah, so if you go down, like scroll down, it has to be assigned, assigned to Audrey, always, yeah, always assigned to Audrey, okay, and the follow up and reminders, with this, it can, it, it, I think it should automatically be the day of, So, I. I think the day that it was it like entered so that's fine understood okay okay perfect no proceeding ah no just leave that it's full no it is just leave that yeah okay so in short that's pretty much it so we need to enter the contract details organization key opportunity and then the assignment only yeah we don't need to touch any of them right no none of those so if we if you go up um it's yes it's name it's name last name email uh email mobile um and then um that's pretty much it because i don't think we're doing what we normally would do source notes or internal notes but we don't we're not doing that anymore okay but
13:00 - Noushad Bhuiyan
I think Telephone is also a required field.
13:04 - jbsol
Yeah. Yeah, so if you go back onto the sheet, is it different?
13:08 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Oh, we got Telephone.
13:10 - jbsol
Yeah, yeah, so yeah, okay, so yeah, Telephone as well. Telephone, Mobile, Source, but you don't need the Source Notes anymore. So, yeah, Source Notes, we don't have to do. Oh, less others. Yeah, yeah, Source is always other, but Source Notes, we're not doing them anymore.
13:29 - Noushad Bhuiyan
We're not doing Source Notes anymore. So you're saying we should, we should not take?
13:36 - jbsol
No, we're not, we're not, we're we're not doing anymore, no, yeah. Okay, okay. Oh, actually, no, no, we are, we are, we are, are. Just, yeah, just, we're doing Source Notes, yeah, nevermind, sorry.
13:47 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Okay, what else? What is, okay, yeah, I got you. And then anything, yeah.
13:56 - jbsol
That's it? And that's it, yeah.
13:59 - Noushad Bhuiyan
bye. go. Yeah, Thank you. Oh, what is the assign by?
14:02 - jbsol
Where it is? Where, yeah, where your name is.
14:08 - Noushad Bhuiyan
So I think it's coming automatically.
14:11 - jbsol
That's coming automatically from whoever is logged in. Look, it doesn't matter too much, but I mean, if the extension is running through Audrey, then it would just be automatically Audrey, correct? Yeah, so, yeah, okay, so we're and yeah, it's fine. You could probably just leave that. It'll just automatically do it. But assign two always to Audrey.
14:35 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Okay. So, the automation we are thinking about, is it always be running thing or it is a one-time run solution?
14:49 - jbsol
Um, it'll kind of be like always running, but it would be like, we can do it like once a day or something, you know what I mean?
14:59 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Thank Understood. Uh, in that case, uh, the automation, uh, if you want to run this thing, uh, you need to keep open your browser and yeah, yeah, correct. Yeah. Your PC should not be, uh, in sleep or, uh, in turn off, you know, yeah, it should be quicker. Uh, and one other thing is, uh, when I, uh, write the script, I need to test these, uh, entries. So, uh, is it okay if I entry some of them? Yeah, yeah, for sure.
15:38 - jbsol
From this account? Yeah, sure.
15:40 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Yeah. Understood. Um, so that's it.
15:45 - jbsol
Uh, after doing these, uh, we need to click on save and close, right?
15:50 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Yeah. And then, uh, click on again, the, uh, plus button and then add the rest.
16:00 - jbsol
That's correct.
16:00 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Understood. So how many entries we need to insert in a certain item sheet?
16:11 - jbsol
I mean, it doesn't, it depends. It depends on how many new entries we put in, but yeah. It depends on how many entries we get into the Excel sheet, yeah. Do you have any idea? Maybe about 70 a day. 70 a day, yeah. about that, yeah.
16:36 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Understood.
16:37 - jbsol
Let's say 200.
ACTION ITEM: Send offer to jbsol re: CRM automation; on acceptance, build/test script (2–3 days) - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/SR68FFbxmW4YRzyF7C7arvy-De6YPssg?timestamp=1003.9999
16:40 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Yeah, yeah. Got you. All right, perfect. I think we should be able to do it.
16:51 - jbsol
Yeah. Right, cool. And so I guess for the order, I, having had one place in the order, do I just like go on your
17:01 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Well, I need to send you an offer in the inbox and you just need to accept that. After accepting, the timer gets started and within the timeframe I need to deliver it to you. After that you can confirm if everything is alright and you can connect with me if needed.
17:24 - jbsol
Okay, but is the timer, from the time that I start, you start the timer if that's outside of my work hours? Or can you stop the project to see if it needs any revision and then I'll come back to tomorrow?
17:42 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Yeah, of course.
17:43 - jbsol
You have a certain amount of time to review the project as well. Oh, okay.
17:50 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Yeah, makes sense. Yeah, cool. And also, I cannot complete within one day, so you can take that stuff.
17:58 - jbsol
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. All sounds good, Nishad, then yeah, just send me that offer over.
18:03 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Thanks for your help, bro. Of course. All right, thanks, mate. You have already shared the sheet, right? Yeah, that's the sheet, yeah, yeah.
18:14 - jbsol
Understood.
18:17 - Noushad Bhuiyan
All right, then, do you have any question to me or something?
18:21 - jbsol
Not really, I mean, just more how long do you reckon it will take? Because we've got a new guy in, so we kind of need this up and running kind of quick.
18:34 - Noushad Bhuiyan
But we don't want to cut corners, obviously. Okay. I think within two or three days, let's say two days. Yeah.
18:44 - jbsol
Okay. Cool. Makes sense. Yeah, that's all for me. Thanks for your help.
18:49 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Yeah, send that offer over and then I'll confirm the order and whatever, yeah. Of course, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay, then. Sending you the. In the chat.
19:03 - jbsol
Yeah, in the final chat. Have a great day.
19:06 - Noushad Bhuiyan
Yeah, you too. See you. Okay, bye.

Based on the sources, the workflow for creating and processing the lead generation extension involves specific administrative, technical, and operational action items.
Administrative & Development Action Items
• Offer and Acceptance: Noushad must send a formal offer to the inbox, which jbsol must accept to trigger the project timer.
• Development Timeline: The script development and testing are estimated to take two to three days.
• Testing Protocol: Noushad will perform test entries directly within the CRM account to ensure the script functions correctly.
• Review Period: After delivery, jbsol has a designated timeframe to review the project and request any necessary revisions.
Extension Workflow Steps (The Process)

To automate the lead generation, the extension must follow these specific steps within the CRM:
1. Navigation and Filtering:
    ◦ Access the "Inquiries" section and navigate to "Key Opportunities". 
    outerHTML:
    <label class="MuiFormControlLabel-root"><span class="MuiSwitch-root"><span class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiIconButton-root jss54 MuiSwitch-switchBase MuiSwitch-colorPrimary" aria-disabled="false"><span class="MuiIconButton-label"><input class="jss57 MuiSwitch-input" name="keyOpportunity" type="checkbox" value=""><span class="MuiSwitch-thumb"></span></span><span class="MuiTouchRipple-root"></span></span><span class="MuiSwitch-track"></span></span><span class="MuiTypography-root MuiFormControlLabel-label MuiTypography-body1">Key Opportunities</span></label>

    ◦ Uncheck my key opportunity, if checked
    <div class="jss39" bis_skin_checked="1"><div class="ui checked checkbox" bis_skin_checked="1"><input class="hidden" readonly="" tabindex="0" type="checkbox" value="" checked=""><label>My Key Opportunities</label></div><div class="ui checked checkbox" bis_skin_checked="1"><input class="hidden" readonly="" tabindex="0" type="checkbox" value="" checked=""><label>Include Open</label></div><div class="ui checkbox" bis_skin_checked="1"><input class="hidden" readonly="" tabindex="0" type="checkbox" value=""><label>Include Closed</label></div></div>


    ◦  "Apply Search" to load the data.
    <div bis_skin_checked="1"><button class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined" tabindex="0" type="button"><span class="MuiButton-label">Apply Search<span class="MuiButton-endIcon MuiButton-iconSizeMedium"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-colorPrimary" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M12 2C6.48 2 2 6.48 2 12s4.48 10 10 10 10-4.48 10-10S17.52 2 12 2zm1 15h-2v-6h2v6zm0-8h-2V7h2v2z"></path></svg></span></span><span class="MuiTouchRipple-root"></span></button></div>


    ◦ Filter the records by clicking the three green lines next to the search button; set the "Assigned to" field to "Audrey" and apply the search again.
    <div class="MuiAutocomplete-root jss66 MuiAutocomplete-hasClearIcon MuiAutocomplete-hasPopupIcon" role="combobox" aria-expanded="false" itemsize="70" name="assignedTo" items="" bis_skin_checked="1"><div class="MuiFormControl-root MuiTextField-root MuiFormControl-fullWidth" bis_skin_checked="1"><label class="MuiFormLabel-root MuiInputLabel-root MuiInputLabel-formControl MuiInputLabel-animated MuiInputLabel-shrink" data-shrink="true" for="assignedTo" id="assignedTo-label">Assigned To</label><div class="MuiInputBase-root MuiInput-root MuiInput-underline MuiAutocomplete-inputRoot MuiInputBase-fullWidth MuiInput-fullWidth MuiInputBase-formControl MuiInput-formControl MuiInputBase-adornedStart MuiInputBase-adornedEnd" bis_skin_checked="1"><div role="button" class="MuiChip-root MuiAutocomplete-tag MuiChip-deletable" tabindex="-1" data-tag-index="0" bis_skin_checked="1"><span class="MuiChip-label">Audrey</span><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiChip-deleteIcon" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M12 2C6.47 2 2 6.47 2 12s4.47 10 10 10 10-4.47 10-10S17.53 2 12 2zm5 13.59L15.59 17 12 13.41 8.41 17 7 15.59 10.59 12 7 8.41 8.41 7 12 10.59 15.59 7 17 8.41 13.41 12 17 15.59z"></path></svg></div><input aria-invalid="false" autocomplete="off" id="assignedTo" type="text" class="MuiInputBase-input MuiInput-input MuiAutocomplete-input MuiAutocomplete-inputFocused MuiInputBase-inputAdornedStart MuiInputBase-inputAdornedEnd" aria-autocomplete="list" autocapitalize="none" spellcheck="false" value=""><div class="MuiAutocomplete-endAdornment" bis_skin_checked="1"><button class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiIconButton-root MuiAutocomplete-clearIndicator MuiAutocomplete-clearIndicatorDirty" tabindex="-1" type="button" aria-label="Clear" title="Clear"><span class="MuiIconButton-label"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeSmall" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M19 6.41L17.59 5 12 10.59 6.41 5 5 6.41 10.59 12 5 17.59 6.41 19 12 13.41 17.59 19 19 17.59 13.41 12z"></path></svg></span><span class="MuiTouchRipple-root"></span></button><button class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiIconButton-root MuiAutocomplete-popupIndicator" tabindex="-1" type="button" aria-label="Open" title="Open"><span class="MuiIconButton-label"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M7 10l5 5 5-5z"></path></svg></span><span class="MuiTouchRipple-root"></span></button></div></div></div></div>
    

2. Data Entry (Repeatable Loop):
    ◦ Click the "+" (plus) button to create a new contact for each entry found in the "Lead Generation, December 2025" Google sheet.
    ◦ Populate Contact Fields: Enter the Name, Last Name, Email, Mobile number, and Telephone (which is a required field).
    ◦ Organization Details: Input the organization details as specified in the spreadsheet.
    ◦ Apply Logic and Conditions:
        ▪ Source: Always select "Other" from the dropdown menu.
        ▪ Area of Law: Always select "Advice".
        ▪ Source Notes: These should be included in the entry.
        ▪ Assignment: The entry must always be "Assigned to" Audrey; the "Assigned by" field will typically default to the logged-in user.
        ▪ Reminders: Set the follow-up/reminder for the current day (the day the data is entered).
    ◦ Finalize Entry: Click "Save and Close" and repeat the process for all remaining entries (approximately 70 to 200 entries per day).
    
Operational Requirements
• System State: For the automation to run, the browser must remain open, and the computer must stay awake (not in sleep or power-off mode).
• Frequency: The extension is intended to run as a daily process rather than a one-time solution.
To visualize this, think of the extension as a digital clerk: it first organizes its desk by filtering for Audrey's files, then opens a new folder for every row in the master spreadsheet, meticulously filling out the same specific forms before filing them away and starting the next one.

### Lessons Learned

- **Chrome Extension Tab Management**: When automating with Chrome extensions, use `chrome.tabs.query({ url: "pattern" })` to find existing tabs matching the target URL before creating new ones. This prevents duplicate tabs and improves UX.
- **Manifest V3 Permissions**: To query all tabs (not just the active one), use the `"tabs"` permission instead of `"activeTab"`.
- **Sidebar vs Popup**: For long-running automations, Chrome's side panel API (`sidePanel`) is superior to popups because the sidebar remains open and visible while the automation runs in the main tab.
- **Extension UI Simplification**: A minimal sidebar UI with just essential controls (fetch, start, progress, log) is more effective than complex multi-panel designs. Use CSS variables for consistent theming.
